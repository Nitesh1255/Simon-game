# Simon-game
Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based game that tests a player's memory and response time. The game features a series of buttons with different colors, and the user must repeat the pattern shown by the computer by pressing the buttons in the correct sequence.

Here is a possible description for building a Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML:

Create a container element to hold the Simon game interface.
Add four colored buttons to the interface that represent different sounds.
Create a start button to begin the game.
Create a display to show the current level and score of the game.
CSS:

Style the container element to position it on the page and set its width and height.
Style the colored buttons to make them visually appealing and easy to use.
Style the start button and display to make them clear and easy to read.
JavaScript:

Create an array to hold the game sequence.
Add an event listener to the start button to begin the game.
When the game begins, the computer randomly selects a button and adds it to the game sequence array.
The computer then plays the sequence of buttons, one by one, with a slight pause between each button.
The user must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
If the user repeats the sequence correctly, the computer adds another button to the sequence, and the game continues to the next level.
If the user makes a mistake, the game is over, and the player's score is displayed.
Create a function to update the display with the current level and score.
Add sound effects to the buttons when they are clicked or played by the computer.
